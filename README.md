Final code challenge complete.
I tried to create a mobile app, but the tooling and whatnot was a bit much to learn on short notice, but I did enjoy beginning to poke around .NET Maui and use the new 
Blazor Hybrid project.
CSS isn't perfect and the performance could use some work, especially considering how slowly the images load on initial page render.

To run, choose Windows Machine in VS 2022.
